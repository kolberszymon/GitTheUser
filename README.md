# GitTheUser

My goal was to create simple, lightweight and pretty looking application for desired user github repositories searching. As the ambitious title suggest it's pretty straightforward to use.

Main features of application are:
- MVC pattern
- Highlighting of syntax
- Unit tests

Highlighting isn't perfect due to complicated nature of discovering file programming language, so we are relying on githubs api information, which provides us only with whole repository language.
